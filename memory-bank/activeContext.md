## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete Booking Management**: Full implementation of counsellor-client booking workflows
2. **CPD System Enhancement**: Complete CPD tracking, validation, and reporting
3. **Notification System**: Implement email and in-app notifications for members
4. **Advanced Search**: Enhanced counsellor discovery with better filtering and search capabilities

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Payment Integration**: Integrate with external payment processors (PayPal, Payfast)
2. **Content Management**: Full admin system for news, events, and educational resources
3. **Reporting Dashboard**: Analytics and reporting for organizational insights
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Continue enhancing mobile responsiveness across all features

### Technical Improvements
1. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching, pagination, and lazy loading
2. **Database Optimization**: Add indexes and optimize complex queries
3. **File Storage Migration**: Move from local storage to cloud storage (AWS S3, etc.)
4. **API Documentation**: Complete API documentation and testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Choices
- **Monolithic Approach**: Maintaining single application for now, considering microservices later
- **Local File Storage**: Acceptable for MVP, plan migration to cloud storage at scale
- **Direct SQL Access**: No ORM complexity, direct database access for performance

### User Experience Priorities
- **Admin Efficiency**: Streamlining complex workflows with intuitive interfaces
- **Professional Standards**: Maintaining high standards for counsellor profiles and verification
- **Member Lifecycle**: Clear pathways from application to active membership
- **Transparency**: Detailed audit trails and communication throughout processes

### Technical Standards
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript usage with comprehensive interfaces
- **Form Validation**: Consistent Zod schemas for client and server validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance considerations in component design

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Component Patterns
- **Modal-First Design**: Heavy use of dialogs for detailed views and actions
- **Tab-Based Navigation**: Multi-section interfaces using tabs for organization
- **Form Composition**: Reusable form components with consistent validation patterns
- **Loading States**: Comprehensive loading and error state management

### Data Management
- **React Query**: Primary state management for server data
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with rollback on errors
- **Cache Invalidation**: Proper invalidation strategies for data consistency
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and recovery

### File Handling
- **Secure Uploads**: Multer-based file uploads with validation
- **Document Management**: Consistent patterns for uploads, storage, and access
- **Public vs Private**: Clear distinction between public assets and private documents
- **Backup Systems**: Automatic backup creation for critical documents

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Successful Patterns
- **Complex Admin UIs**: Successfully implemented intricate admin interfaces using shadcn/ui
- **Payment Workflows**: Built comprehensive payment verification with clear audit trails
- **File Upload Systems**: Established reliable document management with user-friendly interfaces
- **Email Integration**: Working email notifications using Nodemailer with template systems
- **Form Validation**: Robust client-side validation with server-side consistency

### Challenges Overcome
- **Modal Composition**: Complex nested modal systems with proper state management
- **File Upload UX**: Balancing security with user experience in document submissions
- **Payment Tracking**: Building audit trails that maintain data integrity
- **Cross-component Communication**: Managing state across related components

### Areas for Improvement
- **Performance**: Add pagination and virtual scrolling for large admin tables
- **Testing**: Increase test coverage for complex workflows
- **Error Recovery**: Better offline handling and retry mechanisms
- **Mobile UX**: Optimize complex admin interfaces for mobile devices

This active context should be updated regularly as the project evolves, capturing current focus areas and immediate next steps for continued development momentum.
