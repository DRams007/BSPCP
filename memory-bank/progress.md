## Current Status

### Development Stage: MVP â†’ Production Ready
- **Core functionality**: âœ… Implemented and functional
- **User testing**: ðŸ”„ Internal testing completed, external testing pending
- **Performance optimization**: ðŸŸ¡ Basic implementation, advanced caching needed
- **Security review**: ðŸŸ¡ Basic security measures in place, professional audit recommended
- **Deployment preparation**: ðŸŸ¡ Local development complete, production setup needed

### Code Quality
- **Frontend**: Well-structured with TypeScript, consistent component patterns
- **Backend**: Clean API design with proper error handling
- **Database**: Normalized schema with appropriate relationships
- **Testing**: Minimal test coverage, manual testing conducted
- **Documentation**: Basic setup documentation, API docs needed

## Known Issues

### Functional Issues
- **File storage scalability**: Local file storage not suitable for production scale
- **Email deliverability**: No dedicated SMTP service configured for production
- **Payment processing**: Manual payment verification process requires automation
- **Session management**: No refresh token implementation for extended sessions

### Performance Issues
- **Large admin tables**: No pagination implemented for application lists
- **File upload performance**: No chunked uploads for large files
- **Database queries**: No optimization for complex admin reporting queries
- **Frontend bundle**: No code splitting or lazy loading for larger features

### User Experience Issues
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Admin interfaces not fully optimized for mobile
- **Loading states**: Inconsistent loading indicators across components
- **Error messaging**: Some error states lack user-friendly messages
- **Accessibility**: Limited WCAG compliance evaluation and fixes

### Technical Debt
- **Test coverage**: Limited automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- **Code organization**: Some business logic could be better separated
- **Environment configuration**: Development/production configuration gaps
- **Backup procedures**: Manual backup system needs automation

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Monolithic vs Microservices**: Started monolithic, correct for current scale
2. **SQL vs ORM**: Direct SQL approach working well, no ORM complexity needed
3. **Local vs Cloud Storage**: Local storage sufficient for MVP, cloud migration planned
4. **React vs Vue/other**: React ecosystem provides good development velocity

### Technology Choices
1. **shadcn/ui**: Excellent for consistent, accessible component design
2. **React Query**: Perfect choice for server state management
3. **Express + PostgreSQL**: Simple, reliable, and performant for our needs
4. **JWT Authentication**: Appropriate for current session requirements

### Process Improvements
1. **Component reusability**: Strong patterns established, good reuse across features
2. **Form validation**: Consistent Zod schemas provide good developer experience
3. **Error handling**: Comprehensive try-catch patterns with user feedback
4. **File management**: Secure upload patterns with proper validation

## Success Metrics Achieved

- **Membership workflow**: Complete application â†’ payment â†’ approval pipeline
- **Admin efficiency**: Streamlined review process with detailed audit capabilities
- **User onboarding**: Clear pathways for both clients and professional members
- **Data integrity**: Proper relationships and constraints in database design
- **Professional standards**: Verification and approval processes maintain quality
